# code365


	365 days of creative coding. Propably all in Javascript. Probably mostly sound and motion reactive stuff. 

	For my creative coding, I use a helper file called <a href="js/creative.js">js/creative.js</a>, 
	which is a modified version of @seblee's creative.js file - basically with some added functionality and a couple of syntax changes.
	
	I also have another helper file <a href="js/canvas.js">js/canvas.js</a>, which is just a fast and esy way to create a canvas.

	#To create canvas simply say: 
	var ctx = createCanvas(some_random_name);
