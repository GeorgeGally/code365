# code365

<p>
	365 days of creative coding. Propably all in Javascript. Probably mostly sound and motion reactive stuff. </p>
	<p>
	For my creative coding, I use a helper file called <a href="js/creative.js">creative.js</a>, which is a modified version of @seblee's creative.js file - basically some added functionality and a couple of changes to how I prefer to programme.
	</p>
	<p>I also have another helper file <a href="js/canvas.js">canvas.js</a>, which is just a fast and esy way to create a canvas.</p> <br>

	To create canvas simply say: 

	var ctx = createCanvas(some_random_name);
